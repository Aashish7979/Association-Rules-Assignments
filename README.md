Question 

Prepare rules for the all the data sets 
1) Try different values of support and confidence. Observe the change in number of rules for different support,confidence values
2) Change the minimum length in apriori algorithm
3) Visulize the obtained rules using different plots 


1. Books

Apriori Algorithm

Association rules with 10% Support and 70% confidence

Association rules with 20% Support and 60% confidence

Association rules with 5% Support and 80% confidence

visualization of obtained rule



2. Movies 


Apriori Algorithm

Association rules with 10% Support and 70% confidence
Association rules with 5% Support and 90% confidence
Lift Ratio > 1 is a good influential rule in selecting the associated transactions
